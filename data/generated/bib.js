        "abstract": "<p>Autonomous vehicle moral dilemmas matter less for the particular outcomes of potential accidents than for their role in defining the values of the society we wish to live in. Different approaches have been suggested to determine the ethical settings that autonomous vehicles should be implemented in and identify the legitimate agents for making such decisions. Most of these, however, fail on theoretical grounds, facing severe issues related to moral justifications and compliance to the law, or on practical grounds, being insufficiently universal, action-guiding, or technically viable to be implemented. The analogy with the \u201ctrolley problem\u201d has been extensively discussed. However, researchers have rarely tried to adapt this framework to autonomous vehicle cases or investigate how it could be used to address these issues. In doing so, this paper aims to answer the two key problems of autonomous vehicle dilemmas. With regards to the decision-maker, it rejects autonomous vehicle users\u2019 choice-based models, showing the absurdity of both switch of control and adaptative preferences and arguing for common legislator-determined ethical settings. With regards to the decisions themselves, it criticizes both utilitarian views and those based on individuals\u2019 criteria to suggest a deontologist rights-based approach. This allows for the defence of a morally coherent, regulatory compliant, explainable, and easily implementable framework capable of addressing all autonomous vehicle moral dilemma scenarios present in the literature.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>The ethics of autonomous vehicles (AV) has received a great amount of attention in recent years, specifically in regard to their decisional policies in accident situations in which human harm is a likely consequence. Starting from the assumption that human harm is unavoidable, many authors have developed differing accounts of what morality requires in these situations. In this article, a strategy for AV decision-making is proposed, the Ethical Valence Theory, which paints AV decision-making as a type of claim mitigation: different road users hold different moral claims on the vehicle\u2019s behavior, and the vehicle must mitigate these claims as it makes decisions about its environment. Using the context of autonomous vehicles, the harm produced by an action and the uncertainties connected to it are quantified and accounted for through deliberation, resulting in an ethical implementation coherent with reality. The goal of this approach is not to define how moral theory requires vehicles to behave, but rather to provide a computational approach that is flexible enough to accommodate a number of \u2018moral positions\u2019 concerning what morality demands and what road users may expect, offering an evaluation tool for the social acceptability of an autonomous vehicle\u2019s ethical decision making.</p>",

        "abstract": "The advent of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) paves the way to a new era of urban traffic control and management, driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled strategies. This advancement promises significant improvements in infrastructure use optimization, traffic delay reduction, and overall sustainability. The autonomous driving capabilities of CAVs, coupled with the communication technology, allow vehicles to play an active role in urban traffic control: they can follow tailored instructions and can act as highly accurate moving sensors for traffic authorities. However, such improved capabilities come at the cost of unprecedented vulnerabilities to cyber exploitation, and with the concrete potential to increase social and economic disparities. As an extension of TIV-DHW (Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop) on ERS (Ethics, Responsibility, and Sustainability), this letter explores how the AI-enabled routing methodology can enhance urban transportation sustainability while also discussing its ethical implications and challenges.",

        "abstract": "Some criticize the data-driven study of driverless car ethics for relying on deterministic crash scenarios where the focus should be on minimizing the occurrence of accidents instead. Indeed, decisions in road traffic are taken in the domain of risk. A relevant ethical question is, however, whether autonomous vehicles should actually minimize an accident's probability or rather balance the accident's probability and severity. While ethicists\u2019 introspections might lead them to different conclusions, a participatory paradigm in ethics demands to include laypeople's intuitions into the societal debate. In three online studies, we found that the mere minimization of accident probability in ethical dilemmas does not correspond to the views of our sample. Our participants favor a balanced consideration of accident probability and severity. This remains true even if the underlying dilemma is based on a more realistic scenario of allocating minor risks among road users. Our findings furthermore illustrate that trolley problems may be informative for autonomous vehicles and emphasize the importance of transparency if manufacturers and the public do not agree on guiding principles in road traffic.",

        "abstract": "<p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are increasingly embraced around the world to advance smart mobility and more broadly, smart, and sustainable cities. Algorithms form the basis of decision-making in AVs, allowing them to perform driving tasks autonomously, efficiently, and more safely than human drivers and offering various economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, algorithmic decision-making in AVs can also introduce new issues that create new safety risks and perpetuate discrimination. We identify bias, ethics, and perverse incentives as key ethical issues in the AV algorithms\u2019 decision-making that can create new safety risks and discriminatory outcomes. Technical issues in the AVs\u2019 perception, decision-making and control algorithms, limitations of existing AV testing and verification methods, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities can also undermine the performance of the AV system. This article investigates the ethical and technical concerns surrounding algorithmic decision-making in AVs by exploring how driving decisions can perpetuate discrimination and create new safety risks for the public. We discuss steps taken to address these issues, highlight the existing research gaps and the need to mitigate these issues through the design of AV\u2019s algorithms and of policies and regulations to fully realise AVs\u2019 benefits for smart and sustainable cities.</p>",

        "abstract": "While it is widely agreed that automated and autonomous vehicles may provide safety benefits over vehicles with lower level or no automation, due to other road users there will still likely be situations where a collision is unavoidable. What should a vehicle that is operating autonomously do when it has no choice but to have a collision? And who should decide which vehicle manoeuvre is the most acceptable? These situations create moral dilemmas requiring consideration of the most acceptable and moral action of the vehicle. In this paper we explore current research in this domain and work towards enabling ethical solutions. We identify current experimental work (practical studies rather than theoretical studies) on this problem often contains fundamental flaws due to the lack of real-world validity within the studied scenarios. We argue that morality is highly context dependent and that participants need to be more engaged in the choices they are claiming to make. Suggestions for future work include virtual reality or simulation methodologies which promote immersivity to ensure procedural validity whilst retaining safety. We also identify current guidelines contradict public viewpoint and argue public attitude needs to be better understood to give autonomous and automated vehicle manufacturers confidence in their design.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we provide a proof of principle of a new method for addressing the ethics of autonomous vehicles (AVs), the Data-Theories Method, in which vehicle crash data is combined with philosophical ethical theory to provide a guide to action for AV algorithm design. We use this method to model three scenarios in which an AV is exposed to risk on the road, and determine possible actions for the AV. We then examine how different philosophical perspectives on agent partiality, or the degree to which one can act in one's own self-interest, might address each scenario. This method shows why modelling the ethics of AVs using data is essential. First, AVs may sometimes have options that human drivers do not, and designing AVs to mimic the most ethical human driver would not ensure that they do the right thing. Second, while ethical theories can often disagree about what should be done, disagreement can be reduced and compromises found with a more complete understanding of the AV's choices and their consequences. Finally, framing problems around thought experiments may elicit preferences that are divergent with what individuals might prefer once they are provided with information about the real risks for a scenario. Our method provides a principled and empirical approach to productively address these problems and offers guidance on AV algorithm design.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: This study delves into the ethical dimensions surrounding autonomous vehicles (AVs), with a specific focus on decision-making algorithms. Termed the \u201cTrolley problem,\u201d an ethical quandary arises, necessitating the formulation of moral algorithms grounded in ethical principles. To address this issue, an online survey was conducted with 460 participants in China, comprising 237 females and 223 males, spanning ages 18 to 70. Methods: Adapted from Joshua Greene\u2019s trolley dilemma survey, our study employed Yes/No options to probe participants\u2019 choices and Likert scales to gauge moral acceptance. The primary objective was to assess participants\u2019 inclinations toward four distinct algorithmic strategies\u2014Utilitarianism, Rawlsianism, Egoism, and a Hybrid approach\u2014in scenarios involving AVs Results: Our findings revealed a significant disparity between participants\u2019 preferences in scenarios related to AV design and those focused on purchase decisions. Notably, over half of the respondents expressed reluctance to purchase AVs equipped with an \u201cegoism\u201d algorithm, which prioritizes the car owner\u2019s safety. Intriguingly, the rejection rate for \u201cegoism\u201d was similar to that of \u201cutilitarianism,\u201d which may necessitate self-sacrifice. Discussion: The hybrid approach, integrating \u201cUtilitarianism\u201d and \u201cEgoism,\u201d garnered the highest endorsement. This highlights the importance of balancing self-sacrifice and harm minimization in AV moral algorithms. The study\u2019s insights are crucial for ethically and practically advancing AV technology in the continually evolving realm of autonomous vehicles.",

However, as these systems become more prevalent, it is crucial to address the ethical considerations surrounding their deployment and operation. This research paper delves into the multifaceted domain of ethics in AI for Autonomous Driving Assistant System ADAS/AD systems, analyzing various use cases and exploring different scenarios. Ethical concerns in AI for autonomous driving encompass a wide range of topics, including safety, privacy concerns related to data collection and usage, decision-making, ethical dilemmas, accountability, and societal impact. This research focuses on intricate challenges that arise in the field of autonomous driving and investigates these issues by examining real-world use cases. Such exploration is intended to shed light on the complex ethical challenges that arise in the context of autonomous driving. This research paper presents comprehensive investigations of different approaches for designing ethical decision-making algorithms, considering utilitarianism, deontological principles, and the concept of moral responsibility. This research critically assesses the potential consequences for various stakeholders e.g., drivers, pedestrians, etc. This analysis helps us to understand the broader ethical ramifications of the widespread adoption of autonomous driving technologies and the evaluation of the legal and ethical frameworks necessary to address ethical considerations, including liability, accountability, and the establishment of industry standards. The purpose of this research is to advocate for transparency, accountability, and stakeholder engagement as fundamental principles for ensuring the ethical use of these technologies.
